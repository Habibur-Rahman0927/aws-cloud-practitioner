## 🚀 Scenario-Based Questions

### 📝 1. Scenario:

A startup company is developing a mobile application that will allow users to upload and share photos. They anticipate significant growth in user numbers and need a highly scalable storage solution that can handle potentially millions of photo uploads. Additionally, they require a way to easily retrieve and display these images with minimal latency to users around the world. Which AWS service should they use to meet these requirements?

#### Options:
- A. Amazon RDS
- B. Amazon S3
- C. Amazon DynamoDB
- D. Amazon CloudFront

<details>

### ✅ Answer: 

**B. Amazon S3**

### 💡 Explanation:

**Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)** is the ideal choice for this scenario due to several reasons:

- **🔧 Scalability:** Amazon S3 scales seamlessly, allowing it to store an unlimited number of objects, making it perfect for a startup anticipating millions of photo uploads.
- **🔒 Durability and Availability:** S3 offers 99.999999999% (11 nines) durability and high availability, ensuring user photos are safely stored and readily accessible.
- **🌍 Global Distribution:** Combining S3 with Amazon CloudFront (a CDN) ensures rapid, low-latency delivery of photos to users worldwide, enhancing user experience.
- **💰 Cost-Effectiveness:** S3’s pay-as-you-go model is economical for startups, as they only pay for the storage and data transfer they use.

Amazon S3's integration with other AWS services provides a robust, flexible solution for managing and delivering user-generated content.

### 📝 4. Scenario:

A company has a centralized group of users with large file storage requirements that have exceeded the space available on the premises. The company wants to extend its file storage capabilities for this group while retaining the performance benefit of sharing content locally.
What is the most operationally efficient AWS solution for this scenario?

#### Options:
- A. Create an Amazon S3 bucket for each user. Mount each bucket by using an S3 file system mounting utility.
- B. Configure and deploy an AWS Storage Gateway file gateway. Connect each user's workstation to the file gateway.
- C. Move each user's working environment to Amazon WorkSpaces.
- D. Deploy an Amazon EC2 instance and attach an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) Provisioned IOPS volume. Share the EBS volume directly with the users.

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

### ✅ Answer: 
**B. Configure and deploy an AWS Storage Gateway file gateway. Connect each user's workstation to the file gateway.**

### 💡 Explanation:

AWS Storage Gateway file gateway is designed specifically for hybrid storage use cases where you want to extend your on-premises storage with the cloud while retaining the benefits of local file access performance. The file gateway provides a seamless and efficient solution by enabling local access to files and backing them up to Amazon S3. This meets the company's requirements of retaining local performance benefits while extending storage capabilities in an operationally efficient manner.

### 📝 5. Scenario:

According to security best practices, how should an Amazon EC2 instance be given access to an Amazon S3 bucket?

#### Options:
- A. Hard code an IAM user's secret key and access key directly in the application, and upload the file.
- B. Store the IAM user's secret key and access key in a text file on the EC2 instance, read the keys, and then upload the file.
- C. Have the EC2 instance assume a role to obtain the privileges to upload the file.
- D. Modify the S3 bucket policy so that any service can upload to it at any time.

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

### ✅ Answer: 
**C. Have the EC2 instance assume a role to obtain the privileges to upload the file.**

### 💡 Explanation:

Using an IAM role with an EC2 instance is a secure way to grant the instance permissions to interact with other AWS services such as S3. The IAM role provides temporary credentials that AWS rotates automatically and limits to the permissions required for the task. This method avoids the need to manage and securely store long-term credentials, reducing the risk of credential exposure and misuse.

- B. Patching of DynamoDB
- C. Access to DynamoDB tables
- D. Encryption of data at rest in DynamoDB

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

### ✅ Answer: 
**C. Access to DynamoDB tables**

### 💡 Explanation:

Under the AWS Shared Responsibility Model, controlling and managing access to AWS services, including Amazon DynamoDB tables, is a customer responsibility. While AWS takes care of the physical infrastructure, patching, and encryption of data at rest in DynamoDB, customers are responsible for setting up proper access controls, authentication, and authorization to protect their data and resources.
